This project is a simple Python tool that extracts all URLs from the source code of a given website. It helps in gathering external links and resources for web analysis, security audits, or data scraping purposes.

## Features
- Extracts all hyperlinks (URLs) from the provided website's source code.  
- Uses Python's `requests` library to fetch webpage content.  
- Utilizes regular expressions for URL pattern matching.  

## How It Works
1. The script takes a **website URL** as input from the user.  
2. It fetches the webpage source code using an HTTP GET request.  
3. A **regex pattern** searches for and extracts URLs embedded in `href` attributes of anchor tags.  
4. Extracted URLs are displayed as output.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/url-extractor-tool.git
   cd url-extractor-tool
   ```
2. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your machine.
3. Install the required library:  
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python extract_urls.py
   ```
2. Enter the target website URL when prompted. Example:  
   ```
   Enter the website URL: https://example.com
   ```
3. The script will output all URLs found in the source code:  
   ```
   Extracted URLs:
   https://example.com/page1
   https://example.com/page2
   https://external-link.com/resource
   ```

```

## Benefits
- **Security Analysis**: Useful for identifying external resources and links in a website for penetration testing or reconnaissance.  
- **Web Scraping**: Helps gather links for further data extraction or automation tasks.
